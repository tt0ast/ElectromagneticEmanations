# Electromagnetic Emanations
A collection of Processing and Open Framwork Scripts that allow to play music by Van Ecke Phreaking the HDMI Port of a LCD Monitor.

## EME 0.5
The first version of EME, originally performed at IMWI Institutsabend 2022. It is entirely written in Processing. The code itself is not very elegant as all it had to do was to display one precomposed sequence for a concert performance. 
### How to get it working
- the Processing library wellen is needed if you want to use a MIDI Controller to start the performance
- the script is designed for a FullHD (1920/1080) monitor, other monitor sizes will most likely work, but the pitch might be off
- start the script, a test melody of three notes will be played
- position the antenna of an AM Radio near the screen (pointing it directly at the HDMI port worked best for me)
- try sweeping through the frequencies until you hear the three notes
- start the sequence by pressing either the space bar or the assigned button on your MIDI controller
